## Problem it solves


### Problem

There are many websites where you can find code snippets. But you can't save them to your account.

You have to copy the code and save it to Somewhere. This is a very tedious process. And you can't access it from anywhere.

You have to copy the code and paste it in your editor. This is also a very tedious process.

As a Developer, I also facing same issue, I get Bugs in my code, or if have to install some package or Software that I installed earlier, After some time I forgot how to install it, which I learn After going through many websites. like StackOverflow, Github, Linux Documentation, unix.stackexchange.com, etc.

So I have to search for the solution on the internet. But I can't save the code snippets to my account. I have to copy the code and save it to Somewhere. This is a very tedious process. And I can't access it from anywhere. I have to copy the code and paste it in my editor. This is also a very tedious process.
